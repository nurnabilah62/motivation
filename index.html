  <li>By doing online education, it teaches me on how to be an independent person. <br>Since online learning required individual assignments for all the subject for this <br> semester, so I need to complete the tasks given by lecturers on my own.</li>
  <li>It teaches me about time management and I have the flexibility to create my own<br> schedules during at home.  Through online learning, I need to be more focus and alert <br> about the task and assignments. This is because I need to allocate time well in completing <br> the tasks.</li>
  <li>It can demonstrated self-motivation in which I can tackle multiple tasks, set priorities, <br>and adapt to changing work conditions. </li>
  <li>Online learning can enhance my technical skills in using computer. I will be more familiar<br> with new tools and software. Other than that, most of the assessments need to be made <br> by using video presentation. So, I need to learn how to edit the video.  Indirectly, it will<br> increased my knowledges about information technology (IT).</li>
  <li> When learning through online, I can revisit past material or stop the lecture to perform <br>additional research or organize my notes. I can work through the lesson plan at my own<br> pace to ensure I am really mastering the chapter before proceed to the next section.</li></font></span>
